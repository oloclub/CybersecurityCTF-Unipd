# Exam Instruction

A zip folder containing the exercises will be uploaded on moodle.
There are 3 exercises, for a total of 32 points, in the Crypto and Web areas of the course:

1. Exercise 1 – 10 points
1. Exercise 2 – 11 points
1. Exercise 3 – 11 points

If you have problems with files, please contact us immediately.

For each exercise, we supply two additional hints (available on Moodle), that can help you if you need.
Opening a hint will automatically remove 3 points. We don’t give negative grade for an exercise, e.g., if
you open an hint but you don’t solve that exercise.
You can open the same hint all the times you want.

To solve an exercise, you need to find a flag in the spritz{...} format, and send it to us along a
description of what you did to find it (write-up), the eventual code you wrote.

To submit your answer, upload a zip containing all the files on the corresponding assignment on Moodle.

You cannot use online tools to AUTOMATICALLY solve the exercises (e.g., automatic cesar solver that finds the right shift for you), but you are allowed to browse the internet if you have doubts about python functions, libraries, etc.

## NOTES

1. The exercises order doesn’t matter, you can start from whatever you think is the best.
1. If you are stuck, use a hint or move to the next exercise. If you think there is an error in the binary/exercise, please contact us!
1. Remember to use Python 3 or above when running the exercises.
1. Please submit everything you did, even if you did not fully solved the exercises. You can still gain some precious points.
